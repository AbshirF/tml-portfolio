<h3>Never back down</h3>
<p>By far my Favourite fighting movie of all time. Jake was a character that dealt with serious anger management issues and constantly getting into fights. When his family moved states he was the new guy and had his self being fawned on by a popular girl which got him into his first fight since moving which in this event he got beat up and sought out a self defence trainer, a name i have forgotten but he had taught Jake valuable lessons.</p>
<h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>Best superhero movie series of all time!</p>
